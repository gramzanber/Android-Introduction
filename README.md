# Android-Introduction
These are basic Android applications that cover the basics of Android programming, and will introduce
anyone to all the basics needed to start working with the Android platform.

Descriptions of each application and major components covered.
Program 00:
This application will teach basic layout principles and how to change basic text using buttons.
Program 01:
This application will teach you how to have multiple activities (pages) and  how to pass data between them.
You can see be able to pass text from the first activity to the second activity and then have the result
passed back to the first activity.
Program 02:
This application will teach you something a bit more exciting by making a completely original and extremely
exciting game known as Tic-Tac-Toe! Here we introduce the new design layout GridLayout.
Program 03:
This application will teach you an interface that allows users to access the web and phone applications from
your applications. We introduce calling outside applications (such as system applications) and how to pass data to them.
Program 04:
This application will teach you how to make a contact book that sends an email when the email address is
clicked and a second activity that adds a notification to the Android notification dock. We introduce
sending notifications to the user which comes in handy when making services (more on that later). Here we
introduce Android Fragments which are like a dynamic interface that can be popped into an empty space.
Program 05:
This application will teach you how to integrate Google Maps into your application, unfortunately this can
be an arduous task as the Google Maps API requires a lot of permission and setup. Please follow your stack
traces and messages box in Android Studio very carefully because the code works and Android Studio looks
like it is working but if you look very carefully there are like two lines that say No permission. Android
Studio may just give you guidance to fix it, but more than likely you will end up running over to Stackoverflow like I did.
